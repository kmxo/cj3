                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's been an exciting adventure working as a ServiceNow Developer for the past three years. 
                    <br>
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was studying about Cloud Computing long ago and when the chance to work with the platform emerged in 2021, I grabbed it with both hands.
                    <br>
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My previous experience as a software developer was good and bad at the same time. I'll try to explain what happened about my coding skills when applied to the development process.
                    <br>
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2021 - <b>The 1st year</b>:
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first I started coding everything. Record Producer logic & validation was in Client Scripts and all back-end logic in Script Includes. 
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After many NowLearning courses and navigating the community I understood how to use UI Policies to do things (Mandatory, Read-Only, Show/Hide fields) instead of putting everything on Client Scripts. Besides that my understanding of Business Rules reached a decent level.
                    <br>
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2022 - <b>The 2nd year</b>: 
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I invested time learning about ITIL and it was a game changer.
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before every deployment to the test instance I study all findings (Security issues, Performance issues, User Experience issues and so on) and fix them.
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My tech lead was proud of me.
                    <br>
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2023 - <b>The 3rd year</b>:
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a mentee with the ServiceNow Developer Mentorship Program I learned beyond scripting. I started studying the code efficiency.
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to make my code clean for better maintenance? Can it be executed faster?
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this scenario I'm evolving my overall JavaScript and best practices knowledge.
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mentor Ashutosh Munot shared his knowledge and demonstrated patience and empathy for one entire year. Believe me when I say the man is a monk, because I ask a lot of questions! 
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jokes aside, I'll always be grateful for his guidance. 
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for everything teacher!
                    <br>
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays I keep in mind the importance of refactoring, keeping the technical debt under control. 
                    
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I knew how to code I thought it was necessary to code all the time. Now I see that we should know when to code. 
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have tons of capabilities in APIs and as we get to know them, we get the job done with less code.
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as someone said once: No code, No problem!
                    <br>
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for reading!
