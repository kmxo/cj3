                <p>
                    
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been studying about ITAM (IT Asset Management) and this knowledge leads to the mainline certifications like CIS-HAM and CIS-SAM, corresponding to Hardware Asset Management and Software Asset Management.
                    <br>
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning while conducting my studies I came across a Live where Atul "AG" Grover invited Ajay Kumar to share his knowledge about ITOM.
                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was revising my notes and listening to Ajay at the same time but suddenly I couldn't help it. I left my notes and I was totally focused on Ajay speech.
                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the ITOM Discovery is not well executed to populate a CMDB properly, I can't improve any Hardware or Software management process!
                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My conclusion is that ITAM and ITOM are deeply connected and I didn't miss the opportunity to confirm this with the expert.
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm looking forward to the next session!
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
