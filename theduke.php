                <p>
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke was responsible for the maintenance of an Enterprise Application but his current vendor was not offering the desired support. 
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did a google search and discovered a startup called ServiceNow, and at the time the brand color scheme was black & orange. 

                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decided to give it a try and one hour later his MVP was up and running on the Internet. 
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After what “Wow” moment, The Duke purchased the subscription and fully deployed his application. 
                <br>
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays you organize your links into Favorites, search any record by just typing the Number within the Global search and you take all of it for granted, right?
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke explains that in the past it was pretty much only the Navigation Bar. No Favorites, no History, no Global search.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h5>He was fascinated about how straight forward was to create an App.</h5>

                        <p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You go to “Tables & Columns” and add fields in the Dictionary. 
                         <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scope didn’t exist yet, so you have Business Rules and Notifications.
                         <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All notifications were event based, so you needed to learn some JavaScript to use the gs.eventQueue() method. There was no notification conditions at the time.

                     <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Duke, what about debugging? We have gs.info(), gs.warn() and gs.error(), don’t we?</b>
                     <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, we had gs.log() only and we loved it!
                     <br>
                     <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>What about certifications?</b>
                     <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What certifications? Even CSA didn’t exist. The only way to prove experience in ServiceNow was building a solution. 
                     <br>
                     <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Then how to learn ServiceNow?</b>
                     <br>

                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This photograph was the ServiceNow headquarters in San Diego, CA — nearly 500 miles from Silicon Valley. The wooden spaceship. 
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To learn ServiceNow you needed to onboard the spaceship to study there.
                    <br>
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>What about Licenses?</b>
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, you bought one thing from sales: “ServiceNow”. 
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulfillers were fulfillers and that was basically it. 
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you working with tasks? You are a fulfiller.
                    <br>
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Duke, how responsive design was implemented?</b>
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept hadn't been invented yet.
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And talking about the features, you could use ITSM or custom apps. That was the ServiceNow platform. 
                    <br>
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you enjoy the article? That is only a fraction of the amazing history class The Duke taught us today on Linkedin. 
                    <br>
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also emphasized the important role of the ServiceNow MVPs, using creativity to share knowledge about the different aspects of the platform.
